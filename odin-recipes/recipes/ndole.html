    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This meal which originates from the Littoral region in Cameroon consists a perfect culinary marriage <br>
      of vegetable (bitterleaf) and protein (groundnuts/peanuts).  </p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
     <ul>
         <li>2 cups of peeled groundnuts (also called called peanuts)</li>
         <li>3 cups of bitterleaf and/or spinach</li>
         <li>Half teaspoon of baking SODA (for blanching vegetables)</li>
         <li>Â¼ cup crayfish- coarsely blended</li>
         <li>2 pounds of boiled beef/beef feet/smoked fish/stock fish/shrimps </li>
         <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
         <li>1 inch of ginger</li>
         <li>1 maggi crevette (crayfish seasoning cube)</li>
         <li>2 regular seasoning cubes (maggi or knorr)</li>
         <li>1 large onion</li>
         <li>1 cup of vegetable oil</li>
         <li>1 habanero pepper (totally optional)</li>
     </ul> 
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Put your groundnuts in a pot and let it boil</li>
       <li>If using shrimps, season them with a little salt (and white pepper if you wish) and set aside to marinate.</li>
       <li>Chop up your spinach.</li>
       <li>Start the boiling and blanching process. Put water in a pot to boil and put in salt and baking soda. <br>
         The baking soda helps the vegetables retain their green colour just like "Akangwa" or "Kangwa" (lime stone)</li>
        <li>Use the tip of your finger to check the bitterleaf for softness.</li> 
        <li>If soft enough, add in the spinach and turn off the stove. Let it sit for TWO minutes</li>
        <li>Pour vegetable onto a strainer and immediately run cold water on it. If you do not do this, <br>
        the heat will continue to cook the vegetables much to your disadvantage</li>
        <li>When you have rinsed thoroughly, use both hands to roughly kill the vegetables then you squeeze and keep in a bowl. <br>
        Note: slightly more vegetable than the amount below made it to the pot.</li>
        <li>Peel garlic and ginger and chop half of your onions then put in a blender plus <br>
        your boiled groundnuts and pepper (if using).</li>
        <li>Good things are happening here. Go to the pot which contains your boiled meat and/or fish and its stock. <br>
        Here is my pot of stock fish AKA stocky. When you love something so much, you give it a pet name. So for the love of stock fish. <br>
        In Cameroon, stock fish is locally called, "Mukanjo."</li>
        <li>Add your blended groundnuts and bring to boil. Let the aroma bless your home!</li>
        <li>Add in crayfish and stir</li>
        <li>Then let the veggies go in</li>
        <li>Give that a good mix, let it simmer for about 5 minutes and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add maggi crevette, the crayfish seasoning cube.</li>
        <li>Add the left over half onion? Chop it up. Put oil to heat up in a skillet and saute the onions.</li>
        <li>Add in the shrimps</li>
        <li>The shrimps are done when they turn pink. Add them to your pot of vegetable and groundnuts</li>
        <li>Ndole is ready!</li>
     </ul>
