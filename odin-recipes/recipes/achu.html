    <p><img src="../img/achu.jpeg" alt="achu"></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Achu is the traditional meal of a number of villages in the North West region of Cameroon. 
     It is the specialty of the Bamenda <br> or "Bamda" people as I like to say. 
     It is also widely eaten by the Bamilekes in the western region of the country.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>  
     <ul>
         <li>Palm oil</li>
         <li>Canwa or Nikki" (limestone)</li>
         <li>Fish</li>
         <li>Meat</li>
         <li>Water</li>
         <li>Spices (often Called Achu Spices)</li>
     </ul> 
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>You can go to the market and ask to be sold a combination of ingredients for Achu soup <br> and the seller will put these ingredients together for you.</li>
         <li>Burn the fullow before grinding and you may need to add some water at some point to make the <br> mixture quite smooth.</li>
        <li>Wash the Canda (cow skin) thoroughly, rinse well and slice. Add it to the boiling meat and let <br> it boil till ready.</li>
        <li>Add some palm oil and let it boil for a bit.</li>
        <li>Put the pot down then add 'Niki' or limestone to the soup. Melt the limestone in a little water before adding. <br> You can use 'Niki' without melting.</li>
        <li>Add seasoning to your taste.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring till the soup's colour becomes homogenous and yellow.</li>
        <li>Serve.</li>
     </ul>
